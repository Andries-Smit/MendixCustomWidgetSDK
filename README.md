# Mendix Custom Widget SDK

The Mendix Custom Widget SDK helps you in building your custom widgets.
This first version of the SDK helps automating the packaging of your custom widgets into MPK files.
It is depended upon 7-zip (32bit version). 
7-Zip and the .NET framework 4.5.2 are now automatically installed by the setup.

There are two advantages in using this program.

- First you can create an MPK with just a click on a button.
- Secondly this program can instantly place the files you are editing in your favorite IDE into the deployment directory where the widgets are located.

This will save allot of time while you are developing.
This is public BETA and personal project of mine.
Feel free to join in and help make this application better.
